## How to Play

• Clicking on a tile will reveal a different image which it shares with one other tile.<br>
• You can only flip two tiles at a time.
• When you flip over two matching tiles both will remain flipped otherwise they will go back to the default image.
• You win when all tiles are flipped over.
